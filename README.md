Today's Exercise:
# Discount Price Calculator
Shopping during the sales can sometimes be very confusing. With discounted prices at 10%, 20%, 50% or even 70%!
For this challenge you are going to write a Python script that prompts the user to enter a price in pounds (or in your own currency) (e.g. Â£90) and a discount rate to apply (e.g. 20%).
Your program will then calculate and display the discounted price.
We will use the following algorithm for our program:

Requirements:

1. Use OOP to create classes for Currency and Price
2. Write tests for your classes to test the following:
    - Any assertions raised
    - Accuracy of output
    - Correct behaviour when wrong input types are given
    - Correct data types for output

Be sure to include documentation for your classes and methods
